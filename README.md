# Jumping In

Creating a webpage from a TOP provided design.

## Prelude

***I'm scared!*** What if I can't figure it out? What if I can't be creative enough? What if I just keep forgetting over-and-over again the things I've learned? What if I'm just too old and started too late? All the questions and concerns that swirl in my head before I begin this smallest of projects. *My hope is that by the end of this assignment, I will feel more confident and excited to keep moving forward.* **Here Goes!**

## Nearly There

I thought I would update the readme much more often... but I also thought the project would take me at least a week, not a couple days. After following the design layout closely in the beginning, I realized that the palette wouldn't work with the content so I changed a few colors. Nothing major. Just waiting for a few more images to complete the project.

## It's Done

***I did it!*** Yeah, I know it's just a landing page without any bells and whistles, but it is MY landing page. When I first saw the assignment, I was petrified. And forgetting the github clone process reinforced my feelings of inadequacy. But I used the resources, found the answers, and just kept going. I'm sure my code is sloppy - I could probably remove a third of it. I'm also sure that a seasoned professional could've built it in less than an hour and it took me a couple of days. Regardless, I'm encouraged! Not only because I made it work, but also because it was FUN! I'm so excited to learn and do more!

## What I've Learned

1. Do not use colors in class names. If you change the color, the code becomes confusing.
2. Work in sections. TOP was spot on with that one. What initially felt overwhelming, turned into small tasks that eventually led to a finished assignment.
3. Use VSCode extensions - my two favorites: Comment Divider by stackbreak, and Comment Anchors by Starlane Studios. Both keep my code organized and easy to navigate.

***Above all, I have an appreciation for the community.*** Answers to questions are always available because kind people share their knowledge - providing videos, tutorials, and comments on social platforms. ...And it is all conveyed with a tone of encouragement.
