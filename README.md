# Jumping In

Creating a webpage from a TOP provided design.

## Prelude

***I'm scared!*** What if I can't figure it out? What if I can't be creative enough? What if I just keep forgetting over-and-over again the things I've learned? What if I'm just too old and started too late? All the questions and concerns that swirl in my head before I begin this smallest of projects. *My hope is that by the end of this assignment, I will feel more confident and excited to keep moving forward.* **Here Goes!**

## Nearly There

I thought I would visit this page much more often... but I also thought the project would take me at least a week, not a couple days. After following the design layout closely in the beginning, I realized that the palette wouldn't work with the content so I changed a few colors. Nothing major. Just waiting for a few more images to complete the project.
